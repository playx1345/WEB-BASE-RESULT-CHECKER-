  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  credit_unit INTEGER NOT NULL,
  level TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (level IN ('ND1', 'ND2')),
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```
