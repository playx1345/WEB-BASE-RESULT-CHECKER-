# Creating Admin Account

To set up a real admin account with full access, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd scripts
node create-admin.js --email admin@plateau.edu.ng --password Admin123456
```

This will create a **real admin account** stored in Supabase with:
- **Email**: admin@plateau.edu.ng  
- **Password**: Admin123456
- **Role**: admin (stored securely in the `user_roles` table)

## Security Features

âœ… **Secure Role Storage** - Admin role stored in separate `user_roles` table  
âœ… **Protected Access** - All admin operations secured with RLS policies
